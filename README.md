So I done every step...we did it in twos and threes with six experienced eyes...it's still not working. I don't know what we did wrong. I uploaded my steps in Guthub, maybe one can look over it and see an error, fork and correct it, please.

Error:
- I spawn as Tony Hawk
- The Job, Mony, Bank and Job two I don't see
- /setjob 1 police 3 > Player not online.
- /setjob2 testjob 0 > not working
